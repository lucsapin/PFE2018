BOCOP INSTALL NOTES - LINUX
***************************

In the following, <BOCOP> is the folder of the extracted package.
The full path to this folder must NOT contain blanks/spaces.

****************
A. PREREQUISITES

Bocop requires g++, gfortran and CMake.
Please install them if necessary (using yum, apt-get or the system tools)

****************************
B. HOW TO LAUNCH BOCOP (GUI)

The Bocop user interface exists in both 32 and 64 bit.
If unsure of your OS version, just try both, one at least should work ;-)
To launch the Bocop interface (Qt) on 64 bit Linux:
- double click on BocopGui64 in <BOCOP>/qtgui or
- execute the command "./BocopGui64" in a terminal at <BOCOP>/qtgui
For the 32 bit version just replace 64 by 32.

On first launch the GUI will open the default problem "goddard".
You can check your installation by running this problem (green triangle icon).
After some compilation steps, you should see the optimization begin.
Some dependencies have to be compiled the first time you build a problem. 
This can take several minutes.

After optimization, the solution file can be visualized directly from 
the Qt interface, or using the Matlab script (bocop.m), located in the 
folder scripts/.

For more information on using bocop and on the examples of optimal control
problems solved by bocop, please refer to the UserGuide and the Examples
notes available on the Download page (bocop.org).

Note: the settings for the GUI should be saved in
$home/.config/Inria/Bocop-x.x.x.conf

*************************************
C. HOW TO LAUNCH BOCOP (COMMAND LINE)

To build the bocop executable without using the GUI, you can copy the script 
build.sh in <BOCOP>/examples/default into your problem folder, and run it by:
  sh build.sh

The script will invoke cmake/make to build a binary 'bocop'. Run it with
  ./bocop
  
You can edit the script to change the build type from Debug (default) to Release.
