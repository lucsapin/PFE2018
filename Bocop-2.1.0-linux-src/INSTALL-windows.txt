BOCOP INSTALL NOTES - WINDOWS
*****************************

In the following, <BOCOP> is the folder of the extracted package. 
The full path to this folder must NOT contain blanks/spaces.
For instance C:\Bocop-x.x.x is fine, but NOT C:\Program Files\...

For win8 or win8.1 users: if Bocop is installed on disk C:, you may need
to run "BocopGui" as administrator to prevent access rights errors.
Alternately, install Bocop on another disk (not C:).


****************
A. PREREQUISITES

Bocop for windows requires MinGW and CMake, both included in the package.
For Cmake, during the install choose the option to add the CMake path 
in the user PATH environment variable.

A.1 MINGW MANUAL INSTALL
A complete MinGW archive is included in the Bocop package for convenience.
This archive corresponds to a MinGW install with the following components
- msys developer toolkit (include msys base)
- g++
- gfortran
- in MinGW Base System, libpthreadgc-dev 
Bocop install also adds <mingw>/msys/1.0/bin;<mingw>/bin to the PATH variable.


**********************
B. HOW TO LAUNCH BOCOP

To launch the Bocop user interface (Qt), double click the BocopGui link on Desktop.
The executable is located in folder <BOCOP>/qtgui.

On first launch the GUI will open the default problem "goddard".
You can check your installation by running this problem (green triangle icon).
After some compilation steps, you should see the optimization begin.

Please note that some antivirus software can block the compilation process.
In this case you should disable the antivirus, since Bocop requires this step.

After optimization, the solution file can be visualized directly from 
the Qt interface, or using the Matlab script (bocop.m), located in the 
folder scripts/.

For more information on using bocop and on the examples of optimal control 
problems solved by bocop, please refer to the UserGuide and the Examples 
notes available on the Download page (bocop.org).


************************************
C. HOW TO LAUCH BOCOP (COMMAND LINE)

To build the bocop executable without using the GUI, you can copy the script build.sh
given in <BOCOP>/examples/default into your problem folder, and run it with
  sh build.sh

The script will invoke cmake and make to build a binary 'bocop.exe', run it with
  ./bocop

Alternately, you can do the steps manually in your problem folder
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DPROBLEM_DIR=.. <BOCOP>
  make -j

Then go back to the problem folder and run
  cd .. 
  ./bocop
